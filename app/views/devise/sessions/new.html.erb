      <p>Welcome to Garner!</p>

      <p>Garner offers a safe space for users to share their life experiences while garnering support for the issues that matter. Operating as a revolutionary type of social media, users are not only committed to sharing but also to taking action.</p>

      <p>After signing up, you will be able to browse our Vents page to see what issues people are discussing. You can jump in on an ongoing discussion that interests you, or create a new one yourself! We encourage you to share your experiences about issues you see in your world, and connect with those who share similar stories.</p>

      <p>Every Vent post has a certain number of Tallies; support given by users who have viewed the discussion and wish to promote its popularity. Once a thread garners 100 tallies, its author has the option to create an Action page for the topic at hand in the form of a petition. Other users are welcome to view these petitions, and add their signature as support.</p>
